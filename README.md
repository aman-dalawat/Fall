Fall - Open Source Game

🎮 About the Game

Fall is a prototype inspired by Jump King, developed for Android. This was one of my early game dev projects when I was still learning game development. I never expected much from it, but surprisingly, some players wanted updates. Since I don’t have enough time to work on it, I decided to open-source it so that others can learn from it or improve upon it. 🚀
